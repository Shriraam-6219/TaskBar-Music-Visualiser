# Taskbar Audio Visualizer

Taskbar Audio Visualizer is an open-source project aimed at creating an elegant audio visualizer that integrates seamlessly into the Windows taskbar. This visualizer uses system audio as input, rendering dynamic, colorful animations that respond to real-time sound.

## Features
- Displays a live audio visualizer in the Windows taskbar.
- Fully customizable colors for the visualizer.
- Adjustable sensitivity to match your audio preferences.
- Center pulse animation effect for added visual appeal.
